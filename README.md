The exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to a significant increase in data generation, necessitating efficient data management strategies. Traditional cloud-centric architectures face challenges in handling this data deluge due to latency, bandwidth, and scalability issues. 
This thesis proposes an IoT framework for data management at the Edge, aiming to process data closer to its source before transmission to centralized cloud. The framework enhances the efficiency of IoT systems by reducing latency, optimizing bandwidth usage, and improving scalability.
The primary objectives of this research are to develop a robust Edge computing framework that facilitates effective data processing and management, and to enable the deployment of customizable and generic modules from the cloud to the edge. By integrating these modules, the framework adds intelligence and functionality, allowing for real-time analytics and decision-making
